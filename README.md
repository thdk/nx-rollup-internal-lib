# nx-rollup doesn't bundle internal packages

When building a publishable library with rollup (or esbuild), it should be possible to
bundle non publishable libraries.

Note that I would also expect that I can a publishable project may depend on non buildable projects
when the publishable project uses a bundler.

```sh
npm install
npx nx build public
```

Notice that rollup can't resolve the internal-buildable lib and automatically treats it as external.

```sh
> nx run public:build

> rollup -c rollup.config.cjs
